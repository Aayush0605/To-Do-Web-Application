     http-server
     ```
     Access at `http://localhost:8080`.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Calendar Not Loading**:
  - Check internet connection for CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fullcalendar@6.1.15`).
  - The app falls back to the table calendar automatically. For a permanent fix, host FullCalendar locally:
    ```html
    <script src="./fullcalendar/main.min.js"></script>
    <link href="./fullcalendar/main.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
    ```
    Download files from [fullcalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/releases) and upload to a `fullcalendar/` folder.
- **Site Not Loading (404)**:
  - Ensure repo is public and `index.html` is in the root.
  - Verify GitHub Pages settings (Settings > Pages).
- **Buttons Not Working**:
  - Open console (F12 > Console) for JavaScript errors.
  - Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge; latest versions).
- **Jekyll Issues**:
  - Add an empty `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll:
    ```bash
    touch .nojekyll
    git add .nojekyll
    git commit -m "Disable Jekyll"
    git push
    ```
- **Limits**: GitHub Pages allows 1GB repo size and 100GB/month bandwidth (sufficient for this app).
